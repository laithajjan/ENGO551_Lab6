# ENGO 551 Lab 6: Line Simplification

## Objective
This lab is designed to help us gain experience with line simplification using Turf.js library in a web mapping application.

## Overview
In this lab, we created a web mapping application that allows the user to draw a polyline on the map. When the user clicks the "simplify" button, the application will display a simplified version of the polyline drawn by the user in a different color.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage
- Draw a polyline on the map by clicking on the desired points.
- Click the "Simplify Polyline" button to display a simplified version of the polyline in a different color.
- Click the "Clear Polyline" button to remove the polyline from the map and start drawing a new polyline.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Leaflet.js
- Turf.js

## Requirements
1. Map: When a user visits the site, they should be able to draw a polyline on the map.
2. Analysis: When a user clicks on a button on the frontend, the map will show a simplified line of the polyline drawn by the user. There should be another button on the frontend, so that the user can remove the polyline from the map and draw a new polyline.
3. You can use any mapping library of your choice.
